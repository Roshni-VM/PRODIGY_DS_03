# Task 03 – Decision Tree Classifier on Bank Marketing Dataset

## 🎯 Objective
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic and behavioral data.

## 📎 Dataset
- Bank Marketing Dataset from [UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib

## ⚙️ Task Workflow
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset
- Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder / OneHotEncoder
